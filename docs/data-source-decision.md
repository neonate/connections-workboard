# Data Source Selection Decision

**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Phase:** 3 - Data Source Implementation  
**Status:** COMPLETED  

## Executive Decision

After systematic evaluation of 5 potential data sources, we have selected:

- **Primary Source:** [Connections Game IO](https://connectionsgame.io) 
- **Backup Source:** [Connections Archive](https://connections.swellgarfo.com)

## Decision Rationale

### Primary Source: Connections Game IO

**Overall Score:** 66.5% (Highest among all evaluated sources)

#### Selection Criteria Breakdown:
- **Reliability:** 100% (Perfect success rate on all test requests)
- **Response Time:** Excellent (~300ms average)
- **HTML Stability:** Good (60% score with parseable structure)
- **CORS Compatibility:** Requires proxy (standard for external sources)
- **Data Quality:** Good (estimated 70% based on structure)
- **Update Frequency:** Good (estimated 80% based on site activity)

#### Key Advantages:
1. **Perfect Reliability:** Zero failed requests during evaluation
2. **Dedicated Content:** Site specifically focused on Connections puzzles
3. **Structured Data:** Clean HTML structure suitable for parsing
4. **Recent Activity:** Appears to be actively maintained
5. **News Format:** Organizes content in accessible news/blog format

#### Implementation Benefits:
- Multiple parsing strategies implemented for robustness
- Color-based group detection for standard puzzle format
- Flexible word extraction handles various text layouts
- Built-in retry logic and error handling

### Backup Source: Connections Archive

**Overall Score:** 62.5% (Second highest among evaluated sources)

#### Selection Criteria Breakdown:
- **Reliability:** 100% (Perfect success rate)
- **Response Time:** Excellent (~40ms average, fastest tested)
- **HTML Stability:** Limited (20% score due to minimal structure)
- **Historical Focus:** Designed specifically as an archive
- **CORS Compatibility:** Requires proxy
- **Archive Design:** Built for historical puzzle data

#### Key Advantages:
1. **Perfect Reliability:** Consistent accessibility
2. **Archive Purpose:** Designed for historical data storage
3. **Fast Performance:** Fastest response times in evaluation
4. **Unofficial Resource:** Community-driven content
5. **Backup Role:** Excellent fallback characteristics

#### Implementation Benefits:
- Archive-specific parsing for date-based lookups
- Multiple structure parsers (table, list, text)
- Date-specific entry search with fallback to latest
- Identical interface to primary source for seamless failover

## Rejected Sources and Rationale

### Word Tips (56.0% - Third Place)
**Rejection Reasons:**
- Lower reliability (50% success rate vs. 100% for chosen sources)
- Mixed content focus (not exclusively Connections)
- Better suited as validation source rather than primary data source

**Future Consideration:** Could be used for data validation or as tertiary backup

### Times of India (42.0% - Fourth Place)
**Rejection Reasons:**
- Zero reliability (0% success rate during evaluation)
- Appears to actively block automated requests
- Inconsistent URL patterns for historical data

**Future Consideration:** Manual verification only, monitor for access changes

### TechRadar (40.5% - Fifth Place)
**Rejection Reasons:**
- Zero reliability (0% success rate, requests timeout)
- Access restrictions preventing automated fetching
- No successful data retrieval during evaluation

**Future Consideration:** Manual verification only, monitor for access improvements

## Implementation Architecture

### Primary-Backup Strategy
```javascript
const fetcherManager = new PuzzleFetcherManager();

// Register sources in priority order
fetcherManager.registerFetcher(new ConnectionsGameFetcher(), 100);     // Primary
fetcherManager.registerFetcher(new ConnectionsArchiveFetcher(), 80);   // Backup
```

### Failover Logic
1. **Primary Attempt:** Try ConnectionsGameFetcher
2. **Health Check:** Monitor success rates and response times
3. **Automatic Failover:** Switch to ConnectionsArchiveFetcher if primary fails
4. **Recovery:** Automatically return to primary when health improves

### Data Validation
All fetched data undergoes validation:
- Structural validation (4 groups, 4 words each)
- Content validation (unique words, valid levels 0-3)
- Format normalization (uppercase words, consistent structure)
- Source attribution for debugging and metrics

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Primary Risks
1. **Site Structure Changes:** Both sources could modify HTML structure
2. **Rate Limiting:** Sources may implement rate limiting
3. **Access Restrictions:** Sources may block automated access
4. **Content Availability:** Limited historical data across all sources

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Multiple Parsing Strategies:** Each fetcher implements 3+ parsing approaches
2. **Rate Limiting Compliance:** Built-in request delays and respectful access patterns
3. **User Agent Rotation:** Appears as regular browser traffic
4. **Health Monitoring:** Automatic detection of source issues
5. **Graceful Degradation:** Clear error messages with manual input options

## Success Metrics

### Target Performance
- **Primary Source Reliability:** >90% success rate
- **Average Response Time:** <2 seconds
- **Failover Success:** >95% when primary source fails
- **Data Quality:** >95% accuracy on manual verification

### Monitoring Plan
- **Daily:** Automated health checks
- **Weekly:** Success rate monitoring
- **Monthly:** Full re-evaluation if performance degrades
- **Quarterly:** Manual verification of data quality

## Future Considerations

### Source Monitoring
- Monitor rejected sources for access improvements
- Evaluate new sources as they become available
- Consider implementing additional backup sources

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. **API Access:** Investigate if sources offer official APIs
2. **Historical Data:** Build incremental historical database
3. **Data Verification:** Cross-reference between multiple sources
4. **Performance Optimization:** Cache frequently accessed data

## Technical Implementation Notes

### CORS Handling
- All sources require CORS proxy for browser access
- Primary proxy: `https://api.allorigins.win/get?url=`
- Fallback proxy options available
- Error handling for proxy failures

### Data Format Standardization
```javascript
// Standard output format for all fetchers
{
  date: "YYYY-MM-DD",
  gameId: number,
  groups: [
    {
      name: "GROUP_NAME",
      level: 0-3,
      words: ["WORD1", "WORD2", "WORD3", "WORD4"]
    }
  ],
  source: "fetcher_name"
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation with clear error messages
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- User options for manual input or retry
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Conclusion

The selection of **Connections Game IO** as primary and **Connections Archive** as backup provides:

1. **High Reliability:** Both sources achieved 100% success rates
2. **Complementary Strengths:** Primary for current data, backup for historical
3. **Robust Implementation:** Multiple parsing strategies and error handling
4. **Future Flexibility:** Architecture supports adding additional sources

This decision balances reliability, performance, and implementation complexity while providing a solid foundation for dynamic puzzle fetching with appropriate fallback mechanisms.

**Decision Approved:** Ready for Phase 4 implementation (UI integration)
